This repository contains some initial code for the paper [Interpretability in Action: Exploratory Analysis of VPT, a Minecraft Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12161), which appeared at the [Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at ICML 2024](https://icml2024mi.pages.dev/). 
The main codebase is in the "research code" state at the moment, and we will do our best to share it if there is enough interest.
